 
        Samantha stared at the computer screen, the only light in her bedroom. She was a little apprehensive of what she would find once she clicked the red “Start the Chat!” button; it was a feeling not unlike opening an unexpected letter from the IRS. She remembered when she first stumbled across this chat site, how excited she was. A huge pool of users which could be filtered by interest, so that anyone could chat about whatever subject they wanted.
        For her, the subject was erotic hypnosis. Samantha had an interest in hypnosis since her first stirrings of puberty. Thinking back on it, she could only speculate that her fascination had come from various Saturday morning cartoons, where she watched the heroine or damsel-in-distress fell under the complete control of the all-powerful villain. Obedient. Submissive. Helpless. As she matured, she realized she wanted that for herself, to be taken deep into trance, to have her psyche laid bare, to be reshaped into whatever pleased her hypnotist.
        From her experience, it was apparently going to be a lifelong quest to get there.
        She clicked the button, and was connected with a stranger. The automated message appeared: “You and your chatting partner both like Erotic Hypnosis. Enjoy!”
        She waited, and when enough time had passed without activity, she decided to be proactive.
 
You: Hello!
Stranger: Hi.
You: How are you today?
Stranger: Fine.
Stranger: a/s/r?
You: 24/f/sub
Chatbot: The Stranger has disconnected.
 
        “Ok, that one was a sub, too.” She mumbled to herself. She tried to be as indifferent as possible. “Let’s try one more time before bed.”
        She opened another chat session.
 
Stranger: hey there
You: Hi, how are you?
Stranger: whats your trigger?
You: For trance?
Stranger: yep
You: I don’t have one.
You: I haven’t been in trance before.
Stranger: That’s ok,
Stranger: I can give you one,
Stranger: all you hve to do is listen and obey
Stranger: m/f?
You: I’m a girl.
Stranger: Ok my good girl, just feel yourseflf start to relax
Stranger: breath slowly, in and out
 
        Samantha consciously slowed her breathing, and sat back in her chair.
 
Stranger: out loud
Stranger: Count backwards from 10
Stranger: sinking deepeer
 
        She did as she was told, counting under her breath. She was beginning to feel excited as she followed the commands on her screen.
 
Stranger: also type along with what you say
You: 8
You: 7
You: 6
You: 5
You: 4
You: 3
Stranger: fall deeper into trance as you count
You: 2
You: 1
Stranger: Good Girl. Deep int rance
Stranger: You will orgasm everytime I say “good girl”
Stranger: GOOD GIRL
Stranger: GOOD GIRL
Stranger: GOOD GIRL
 
        Samantha saw the words and understood what they were supposed to do, but… nothing. Nada. She was awake, sitting here in her chair in the middle of the night, definitely not orgasming.
 
Stranger: Now my girl, what are you wearing?
You: A t-shirt and shorts
Stranger: the shorts come off now,
Stranger: go deeper as you obey
Stranger: do it now…….
 
        Samantha stood up and pulled her shorts down, leaving them around her ankles as she sat back down. She was fairly sure she wasn’t in trance. She still felt a nice rush from willingly doing tasks demanded of her, but she was under the impression that hypnosis would leave her completely unable to disobey. She wanted to be in a position where she could struggle against it as much as she wanted to and it wouldn’t make any difference how quickly her shorts came off.
        Maybe she would slip under if she tried to focus on what trance would be like?
 
Stranger: Are they off??
You: Yes.
Stranger: GOOD GIRL
Stranger: GOOD GIRL
Stranger: GOOD GIRL
Stranger: GOOD GIRL
Stranger: You will addrress me as “Sir” or “Master”
Stranger: understand?
You: Yes, Sir.
Stranger: GOOD GIRL
Stranger: is my girl wearing panties?
You: Yes, Master.
Stranger: what color?
You: Grey, Sir.
Stranger: Very good. Skype?
You: I’m not comfortable enough for that, Sir.
Stranger: ok, we’ll work on that,
Stranger: go deeper for me
Stranger: feel yourself going blank, no thoughts except my will
Stranger: everytime I say “DEEPER” you feel weak,
Stranger: unable to think for yourself
Stranger: DEEPER
 
        Samantha disconnected. She felt depressed and disgusted. It was late. She needed to go to bed.
       
       
        The next day, Samantha went through the motions of living. Waking up, breakfast, a light jog through her neighborhood. A lazy Sunday morning. She didn’t think too much of the debacle last night, busying herself with household chores. It was evening before she got back on her computer, logged on to her favorite hypnosis-related image site, and started scrolling through a mountains of pictures that just weren’t well-done enough to make her feel anything.
        She was considering trying something more vanilla when one of her friends sent her a message:
 
The_Id_Monster: What’s up?
Tweety44: Nothing.
Tweety44: Actually,
Tweety44: not feeling so good.
The_Id_Monster: ?
Tweety44: It’s just,
Tweety44: for actual hypnosis,
Tweety44: files don’t work, and finding random people to chat with usually means you’ll find an asshole 90% of the time
Tweety44: An asshole who pushes you more than you’re comfortable with.
The_Id_Monster: I personally prefer the fantasy to the real thing.
The_Id_Monster: It avoids a lot of those problems
Tweety44: Yeah,
Tweety44: but the thing is, other people have no problem with it.
Tweety44: I’m so jealous!
The_Id_Monster: I’ve heard that it just takes time
The_Id_Monster: It’s like learning the piano or something.
Tweety44: Eh,
Tweety44: I dunno.
The_Id_Monster: Well,
The_Id_Monster: do you think
The_Id_Monster: a smaller community would help?
The_Id_Monster: There’s this new site called Sleepychat
The_Id_Monster: Since it’s so young, it’s got a small community
The_Id_Monster: like only 30 people at a time.
Tweety44: You think that’ll help?
The_Id_Monster: It could.
The_Id_Monster: I’m thinking about the difference between a state college with hundreds of thousands of students, and a small university with a couple thousand,
The_Id_Monster: The teachers had more time to devote to each student, and things were less crazy.
Tweety44: Makes sense.
The_Id_Monster: So you’ll try it out?
Tweety44: Yeah, in a little bit.
The_Id_Monster: Good. ‘Cause you’re more beautiful when you’re happy. ;)
Tweety44: :)
 
        She logged out of the site, then decided to make herself some dinner. As she boiled pasta, she mulled over the conversation. What he said sounded promising, but she wasn’t completely convinced. Who’s to say whether people weren’t assholes there, too? Instead of the school analogy, it could be the difference between being with a creepy pervert in a big room and being with a creepy pervert in a small room. Then again, maybe she should try to have more faith in people.
