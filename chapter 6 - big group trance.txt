	Samantha was in school, walking to her next class. A student with short white hair met her eyes from across the hall, and held up his hand. She immediately froze in place, unable to move at all. They remained like that, her frozen and him holding up his palm to her, until the bell rung and the classes emptied out. He walked over to her, hand still outstreched, and smiled a sinister smile.

	"I've been waiting all day to do this."

	She tried to do something, say something, but she couldn't. He laid his free hand on her right breast and squeezed gently. She darted her eyes between his hand and his face, not even able to change her facial expression. He grabbed her skirt, and pulled it down around her legs. He grabbed her ass, and pulled her panties down. He put his lips to hers, and kissed her. She kissed him back.

	When Samantha woke up, she was nude. After glancing around, she found her clothes piled up on the floor next to her bed. *That was a weird dream*, she thought, *It's odd that I can remember it so clearly*. She shrugged and picked up some of her clothes. She saw that her phone's notification light was blinking, and turned it on to see a new Skype message.

The_Id_Monster: Heya I heard about you on Sleepychat last nite!
The_Id_Monster: Sounds like you had a lot of fun :)
Tweety44: *blushes* you heard about that?
The_Id_Monster: I said I was a freind of yours and they told me
The_Id_Monster: And I heard you... you know
Tweety44: Yeah
Tweety44: I came
The_Id_Monster: XD
The_Id_Monster: I told you it would be great
Tweety44: It was
The_Id_Monster: Ely also told me of some other suggestios he/scott gave you
Tweety44: Wha???
The_Id_Monster: Like, each night before you go to sleep, you undress and forget about it
The_Id_Monster: "Barring exeptional or unforseen circumstances, of course"
Tweety44: Well I guess that explains that
The_Id_Monster: He told me of one other, but I don't want to spoil it for you
The_Id_Monster: :)
Tweety44: :(
The_Id_Monster: :) :)
The_Id_Monster: Oh gotto run
The_Id_Monster: Later

	She thought about that. Tonight she would try to not take off her clothes, just to see if she could resist the hypnosis. 

	She went to work and had a fairly boring day, but as soon as she got home she hopped on sleepychat and opened the public chat.

TheQuestioneer: Okay all. Bratty subs; love 'em, hate 'em, indifferent to 'em?
Jolly: LOVE EM
GThor: indifferent leaning towards love :v
ElysianTail: It definately makes for a challenge, some subs are into the struggle.
EnchantingBear69: Personally I find them cute to entertain then shut up with hypnosis
Tristan: I love bratty subs lol its makes their fall all the sweeter
EyesSoDeep: I like my subs deep and compliant - no bratty unless part of a RP element
~Alex~: Love'm
mindlesskristi: what EyesSoDeep said
~Alex~: I'm with Tristan
Tristan: But sooo fun to play with
EyesSoDeep: But I'm generally more into guided narrative stuff so it doesn't fit well with my style, I guess
TheQuestioneer: Noted
9:42:39 pm: [INFO] TheQuestioneer has left
Tristan: Woo!

9:42:59 pm: [INFO] EnchantingBear69 would like to chat with you privately!
9:42:59 pm: [INFO] Click *here* to enter the private room.

	Samantha entered the room, wondering what this hypnotist would do to her.

9:42:59 pm: [INFO] SamIAm has joined.
9:42:59 pm: [INFO] EnchantingBear69 has joined.
EnchantingBear69: Hi
SamIAm: Hi
EnchantingBear69: So, I see you're up for some hypnosis
SamIAm: *giggles* yeah
EnchantingBear69: Well, I've got just the idea
EnchantingBear69: Not my idea though, some guy on here did it the other day
SamIAm: What is it?
EnchantingBear69: wait and see!
SamIAm: ... ok
EnchantingBear69: :)
EnchantingBear69: Do you have any triggers?
SamIAm: Not sure what you mean'
EnchantingBear69: Do you have something I can say that will instantly bring you into trance?

	As soon as he said that, she got a message jolted into her head, but not from the chat. *You do, actually. When someone says "Hypnotime" you'll go into trance. I thought that might make things easier :P*. She knew the message was from ScottB, and that he made it so she would only remember it when someone told her what a trigger was.

SamIAm: Well that's weird
EnchantingBear69: What?
SamIAm: I do, and I didn't even know it
SamIAm: ScottB made it so I wouldn't know I even had one until someone asked me
EnchantingBear69: o.o
SamIAm: "Hypnotime"
EnchantingBear69: You ready?
SamIAm: Yup
EnchantingBear69: Hypnotime

	Samantha felt something, like a wave of sleepyness, and then she was wide awake, refreshed, and feeling great\

EnchantingBear69: Hi
SamIAm: I feel great!
EnchantingBear69: :)
EnchantingBear69: But I have a question

	Two words popped into her head. She didn't know what they meant, but she knew they were true

SamIAm: Chat slave
EnchantingBear69: Good
EnchantingBear69: Now close this window, if you please, and head on over to the public chat

	Before she could think her arms were already on their way, and no matter what she tried to do she couldn't stop them, although she didn't have much time to try. She closed the private chat and went back to the public chat.

EnchantingBear69: Guess what everybody!
EnchantingBear69: We have a new chat slave, and her name is SamIAm!
Tristan: Woo!
SamIAm: What exactly does that mean?
EyesSoDeep: He didn't tell you?
Jolly: You have to do whatever anybody in the public chat says
SamIAm: o.O
