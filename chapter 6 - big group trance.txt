	Samantha was in school, walking to her next class. A student with short white hair met her eyes from across the hall, and held up his hand. She immediately froze in place, unable to move at all. They remained like that, her frozen and him holding up his palm to her, until the bell rung and the classes emptied out. He walked over to her, hand still outstreched, and smiled a sinister smile.

	"I've been waiting all day to do this."

	She tried to do something, say something, but she couldn't. He laid his free hand on her right breast and squeezed gently. She darted her eyes between his hand and his face, not even able to change her facial expression. He grabbed her skirt, and pulled it down around her legs. He grabbed her ass, and pulled her panties down. He put his lips to hers, and kissed her. She kissed him back.

	When Samantha woke up, she was nude. After glancing around, she found her clothes piled up on the floor next to her bed. *That was a weird dream*, she thought, *It's odd that I can remember it so clearly*. She shrugged and picked up some of her clothes. She saw that her phone's notification light was blinking, and turned it on to see a new text message.
