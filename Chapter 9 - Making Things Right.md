Annon already had the contents of this chapter spoiled to him because he read my secret plans file. *pouts* - ScottB


------------

  Samantha ran inside. The embarrassment of Andrew seeing her like that, and even groping her, were still hot in her memory. It was that tist Jolly who did this, the trigger that made her have to masturbate. She wasn't angry at him, but she wanted that removed. Would it even be possible to remove it? It was hard to think, she was already horny.

  She stripped her shorts off and got on her laptop. After ctrl+tabbing through a bunch of smut, she finally found the Sleepychat tab and logged on.

`PennyDreadful: MesmerAdam, I may be a cow like greeting, but I have the swiftness of a mongoosee`

`SamIAm: Hi all!`

`ScottB: Hey Sam!`

`Dunkel-fish: Hi SamIAm`

`SamIAm: Okay I have a question `

`Mira: wow, that was intense `

`SamIAm: is it possible to get rid of a suggestion?`

`ScottB: Oh yeah, it's pretty easy `

`ScottB: Do you have one you want to get rid of?`

`SamIAm: Kinda yeah. At least make it not work for a certain person `

`8:33:27 am: [INFO] ScottB would like to chat with you privately!`

`8:33:27 am: [INFO] *Click here to enter the room*.`

  She entered the room, but what was he going to do? Was it as simple as putting her in a trance and saying "the suggestion no longer effects you?"

`8:33:29 am: [INFO] For your safety, private rooms are logged and viewable only by the Admin. The room can opt out of logging if all users opt out. You can opt out by typing "/private" into chat.

`ScottB: So what's the trigger?`

`SamIAm: Jolly gave it to me. Whenever someone asks "has anything else been going on?" I get incredibly horny`

`ScottB: Oh my`

`ScottB: I can see why you'd want that removed`

`SamIAm: Yeah my cousin accidentally used it and it was super embareassing`

`ScottB: Jeez, what happened? If you feel like talking about it of course `

`SamIAm: I don't really even want to think about it, it was *super* humiliating `

  Thinking of it, she actually didn't mind so much being humiliated like that, in that particular case. The idea of being forced to humiliate herself was incredibly arousing, although she didn't actually want to do it, at least not yet. Some fantasies should remain fantasies.

`ScottB: Well we'll get your head straighted out in no time :)`

`SamIAm: :)`

`ScottB: Are you ready to start?`

`SamIAm: Yep`

`ScottB: Hypnotime `

  She suddenly felt like she was falling insider her mind, her brain "opening up" so to speak. Then she was suddenly wide awake and feeling great, like she always did coming out of hypnosis.

`ScottB: Hi`

`SamIAm: Hi :P`

`ScottB: How do you feel?`

`SamIAm: Great!`

`ScottB: The trigger should be gone, but do you know of any way to test it?`

`SamIAm: No, it doesn't work in text I don't think`

  Suddenly, her phone started to ring. She glanced at her phone, and Andrew's face was displayed on her screen. 

`SamIAm: Oh someone's calling, gtg` 

  She sighed and picked up her phone. Should she answer? He might be calling to apologize for his behavior, but he might also pester her for some more changes to his site. She answered the phone.

  "Hey, Andrew."

  "Sam! I just wanted to let you know that I know the truth."

  What the heck? Did he know that she was into being hypnotized?

  "Oh you do? And what truth is this?"

  "Oh come on, we both know it. The truth about why you suddenly have to 'go to the bathroom' whenever I ask what else has been going on."

  "Okay. So what are you calling for?"

  "I just wanted to know your opinion about... that thing."

  He didn't really know anything about it! He was just phishing for information, and doing a rather poor job of it too. Might as well mess with him a little, he deserved it.

  "It's terrible! How they take away our choice like that!"

  "I know, right? Is there anything you can do about it?"

  "Not really, once they put us in the brainwashing chamber we can't talk to anyone about it unless they already know."

  She could hear him gasp on the other side of the phone. This was going to be good.

  "What does it feel like, the brainwashing?"

  "I don't know, they wipe our memory."

  "What kind of stuff do they brainwash you for? Like turning you into a sex slave?"

  Wow, he had a dirty mind. Was he really so gullible? She couldn't think of what to say next.

  "Er... yes?"

  "I knew it! Do you have to act like a sex slave all the time, or is there a word they say to activate it?"

  "Yes, I mean, there is a word. It's 'Yudkowski'"

  "Really? Okay, Yudkowski"

  Oh wow, he was really going to try and use it? Might as well go along with it.

  "How may I serve you, Master?" She was trying to sound as robotic as possible.

  "Oh, I like that. Send me a pic of your boobs, naked I mean."

  He was seriously trying to do that? Could probably mess with him a bit though.

  "You are not a registered user, place a sum of 100 US dollars in a letter on the subject's doorstep for her to transfer to the slave guild to become a registered user for this subject."

  "What! I don't have that kind of money, is there any other way to become a registered user?"

  "There is not. Subject will return to normal state in 30 seconds, do you wish her to have memory of her time as a slave?" This was hilarious.

  "No, no, and could you remove the memory of her time since I called her as well?"

  "Memory erased. Returning to waking state." She waited a moment. "Hey Andrew, why'd you call?"

  She heard a sigh of relief. "Oh, I just wanted to say hi."

  "Oh, okay then. I feel really weird now, like I should remember something..."

  "Maybe you're sick! You better get some rest." Well this was going to make for some interesting conversations in the future. "Has anything else been going on?"

  She felt a burst of arousal, then a moment of weird confusion like her body hadn't caught up with her mind yet, and then she felt exactly like she had a moment earlier. "No, you?"

  "Huh? No, nothing else. Well I'm going to go let you get some rest, I have some stuff to research."

  "Okay, see you later then."

  She glanced at the clock. It was past nine, and she was a little tired. She decided to work on a work project for a little bit, then go to bed. 

  Although, when glancing down, she realized that her panties were sitting on the floor next to the chair...
