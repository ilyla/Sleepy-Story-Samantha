        When Samantha woke up the next morning, she glanced at her phone. It was still morning, and she had to sheild her eyes from the brindingly bright time and date displayed on the screen. When her eyes adjusted, she saw a clear "7:03". She had woken up a bit earlier then she needed to, despite how late she had gotten to bed. She never needed an alarm clock, because for some reason she always woke up at around the same time, even when she got to bed late. 
        As she was getting dressed, her phone jingled. She glanced at the screen to see a text from a coworker, Heidi.
