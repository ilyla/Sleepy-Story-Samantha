	Despite the sunny day, Samantha's room was still dark when she woke up. She liked it that way. She rolled over in her bed to reach for her phone, and pressed the lock button. The screen sprang to life with the time, and she had to shield her eyes from the blindingly bright light the phone shined on her. When her eyes adjusted, she saw a clear "7:03". She had woken up a bit earlier then she needed to, despite how late she had gotten to bed. She never needed an alarm clock. For some reason, she always woke up at around the same time, even when she got to bed late. She didn't have to go to work until 8:00, so she figured that she would probably be able to check out that site, sleepychat or something.
	As she was getting dressed, her phone jingled. She glanced at the screen to see a text from a coworker, Heidi.

Heidi: Where r you?!! It starts in 2 minutes!

	She was confused for a moment, and then it hit her. She and a couple of others in her group had a big meeting with McGraw Hill Education. A meeting that started at 7:10. She threw on the rest of her clothes, grabbed a disposable toothbrush out of the bathroom drawer, jumped into her car, and drove just slightly above the acceptable speed. When she arrived, she was only 5 minutes late. She mumbled an apology and sat down in the conference room, and Heidi gave her a smile. Luckily for Samantha, it was a Friday and nobody was very happy about having to wake up 50 minutes earlier than usual, so nobody seemed to mind too much. She sped through the rest of the workday, mostly on autopilot. The biggest annoyance of her entire day was at having to tell everyone that no, she wasn't sick or something, she just hadn't put on any makeup.

	Samantha got home at 4:32, and proceeded to pour herself a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios and sit down in front of her laptop. She browsed through the subreddit “/r/erotichypnosis” for a few minutes, looking at questions on where to find various files, questions about hypnosis, hypnotists sharing inductions, and the like. She checked Brandon Sanderson's blog to see how far away his next book was, and spent a little time reading on Quora. 

	A few minutes later, a Hangouts message popped up.

<04:49 PM>
The_Id_Monster: Did you check out that site?
Tweety44: what was it called again?
Tweety44: Oh yeah sleepychat
The_Id_Monster: I just did some roleplay on there and it was uber-fun
Tweety44: Uber? Really?
Tweety44: also I thought it was for real hypnosis
The_Id_Monster: you can pick which type you want
Tweety44: Ah ok
Tweety44: I'll go check it out
The_Id_Monster: I'll keep quiet then. Have fun!

	She opened Google Chrome and went to sleepychat.com. She was immediately presented with a box with the title "Welcome to sleepychat". Below this was a simple form asking for a username, gender, role, and whether or not the user wanted to roleplay. She filled out all the information, and clicked "start matchmaking" at the bottom. No later than she had clicked, she was connected to "ScottButcher".

ScottButcher: Hi!
SamanthaIAm: Hello!
SamanthaIAm: I'm a bit new here...
ScottButcher: Hehe, that's okay. Pretty much everyone is, this site is only a couple months old.
SamanthaIAm: Well, okay
ScottButcher: So how are you today?
SamanthaIAm: Pretty good
SamanthaIAm: You?
ScottButcher: I'm doing pretty well myself
ScottButcher: Have you come here to be hypnotized, or just chat?
SamanthaIAm: Hypnotized. It would be my first time, actually
ScottButcher: Ah, fun
ScottButcher: Well, what are your limits?

	Nobody had ever asked her that on Zetle. It seemed that these people understood basic courtesy. She already had a good feeling about this.

SamanthaIAm: Uhh... no Skype please. And also nothing dangerous
ScottButcher: Of course :)
ScottButcher: Are you ready to begin? You don't have to go to the bathroom?
SamanthaIAm: Yep and yep
ScottButcher: Okay then. Are you sitting down?
SamanthaIAm: Yeah
ScottButcher: Please trace 2 diamonds on the ground with your toes, one per foot

	That was weird... not like any induction she had ever seen. But she traced the diamond.

SamanthaIAm: ok
ScottButcher: Now, trace a circle around each diamond

	She did so, more quickly than she had traced the diamond.

SamanthaIAm: ok
SamanthaIAm: now trace 2 squares, 1 around each circle

	She obediently traced the squares.

ScottButcher: Now re-trace the diamonds, please

	It was getting easier and easier to do as he asked, without thinking.

ScottButcher: now retrace the rest of the shapes, then do it over and over again
SamanthaIAm: ok

	She kept tracing, and she was getting more and more into it, focusing more and more on the tracing. In the next instant, something felt different. She felt like she just had a good night’s rest: wide awake, relaxed, and yet somehow energetic, and no longer tracing shapes with her toes.

ScottButcher: How do you feel?
SamanthaIAm: Great! But what just happened?
ScottButcher: I hypnotized you :)

	Could he really have? He hadn't really done anything to prove it, but then again she didn't remember anything since she was tracing shapes.

SamanthaIAm:  ...prove it
ScottButcher: first I'd like to ask, are you okay with erotic hypnosis?
SamanthaIAm: Totally
ScottButcher: Okay then. Are your eyes green?
SamanthaIAm: yeah? How did you know?
ScottButcher: is your hair red?
SamanthaIAm: okay this is creepy
ScottButcher: Are your breasts 34DD?
ScottButcher: Are your panties red?
SamanthaIAm: Uhh... maybe?

	Oh my god. He really had hypnotized her. She felt shocked, amazed that it had finally worked. He hadn't really done anything with her yet, but just being able to find out all that information about her, without her knowledge, was a big turn-on in and of itself.

ScottButcher: :)
SamanthaIAm: I know you just asked me all that while I was in trance
ScottButcher: Nope, guess again
SamanthaIAm: Uhhh
SamanthaIAm: You live next door?
ScottButcher: Nice guess, but no
ScottButcher: If I ask a question in brackets, you answer it and then forget the exchange ever happened
SamanthaIAm: really??? 
SamanthaIAm: what color is my shirt?
ScottButcher: Blue with a yellow batman symbol
SamanthaIAm: What no way! That’s so cool!
ScottButcher: Thank you :)
ScottButcher: Actually I know that you're wearing a blue shirt with a yellow batman symbol, white shorts, red panties, and a beige bra
ScottButcher: That list seems a little long, doesn't it? Maybe we should make it a little shorter...
SamanthaIAm: And how are you going to do that?
ScottButcher: I was thinking we could start with the shorts

	No sooner had he said that, Samantha started to get up so she could take them off, without really thinking about it. She reached down to grab the sides, but realized what she was doing and tried to stop herself. Nothing happened. It felt like someone else was inside her body, taking off her shorts and throwing them to the side for her, while the only thing she could do was watch. It scared her a little, but she had to admit that it was really hot.

SamanthaIAm: Hey! How'd you do that?
ScottButcher: With my ninja-like powers of hypnosis
SamanthaIAm: It occurs to me that you never said you could *only* put a question inside brackets
ScottButcher: Oh, you're a clever one. Yep, I can put anything I want inside brackets.
SamanthaIAm: ...
SamanthaIAm: I'm feeling a little vulnerable now
ScottButcher: :)
ScottButcher: That tends to happen.

	Samantha looked at the clock. “Holy crap, where did the time go,” she asked herself. She had started at 5:04, and it was already 6:12. Not only that, but her stomach began to growl.

SamanthaIAm: Wow... I uhh... I need to go. I just realized how hungry I am :)
SamanthaIAm: Thanks!
ScottButcher: No problem!
[INFO] SamanthaIAm has left.

	Samantha closed the browser tab, but remained in her seat. For a moment, she almost had trouble thinking straight. “Had he really hypnotized me?” Just that thought gave her the greatest feeling she’s felt in a long time. She still couldn’t believe it. She looked down to the clothes now on the floor, and that simple action sent another wave of sensations crawling up her spine. Deep in her thoughts, she almost didn’t catch the second, more intense growl that came from her stomach.
