Short chapter, this one. Don't worry, the next one will make up for it.

------------

  After her success last night, Samantha couldn't wait to try sleepychat again. After struggling for so long to see her fantasy become reality, she couldn't believe how easy it was to finally get results. She had almost begun to blame herself for not trying hard enough to be a good subject, but last night seemed effortless, more like a casual conversation than a semi-mystical domination of her mind. She definitely wanted more. She needed more.
  So, after a productive day, Samantha sat down at her computer, and made her way to sleepychat.com once again. After filling out and submitting the simple form, she was almost immediately connected.
  

`*7:44:07 pm: [INFO] Hi there, SamanthaIAm! You're now connected to the server.*`

`*7:44:07 pm: [INFO] Waiting for a new chat partner...*`

`*7:44:15 pm: [INFO] Found a chat partner! Say hello to ScottB, a male hypnotist.*`


  This was the same guy as last time, she realized. She felt her heart jump. It took her a few seconds to realize that her partner had said anything.


`ScottB: Hi`

`SamanthaIAm:Oh, hi :)`

`ScottB: Ah, you again :)`

`ScottB: From yesterday`

`SamanthaIAm: Yes, that's right.`

`ScottB: So, are you looking to be hypnotized again?`

`SamanthaIAm: I am`

`ScottB: Okay :)`

`ScottB: Is there anything you want to do in particular?`


  Samantha didn't care what he did to her. All she knew is that she needed to feel that feeling again. She needed to experience that loss of control, and this person was the only so far to do just that. Her hands trembled as she made out her reply.


`SamahtaIAm: Um... Anything really.`

`ScottB: Okay`

`ScottB: I've had an idea I've been wanting to try out`

`ScottB: So this session is going to be pretty short, and you won't remember most of it, but it should be fun for you too`

`ScottB: Not what I usually do, but it should be fun :)`

`SamanthaIAm: What's the idea?`

`ScottB: Heheheh you'll see`

`ScottB: It'll be more fun if it's a suprise`

`SamanthaIAm: Well okay`

`ScottB: It's sorta a weird idea, but it's really cool`

`ScottB: Are you ready to start?`

`SamanthaIAm: sure`


  Samantha typed in the number 5 and hit enter. She didn't remember exactly why, but the moment she did, she felt wide awake, alert, and better than her best night's sleep. As she stretched her arms high above her head, her chat partner sent another message.


`ScottB: Hi`

`SamanthaIAm: :)`

`ScottB: How do you feel?`

`SamanthaIAm: wow... I feel great...`

`SamanthaIAm: so what did you do this time?`

`ScottB: It's a secret :)`

`ScottB: You'll see.`

`SamanthaIAm: what do you mean?`

`ScottB: It'll be a surprise!`


  Samantha took a moment to think. She tried as hard as she could to remember the trance, but she couldn't, and scrolling up past the number 5 looked like a completely blank space. Her breathing picked up in no time at all. She just couldn't believe what was happening, yet her eyes refused to let her deny it. After a long moment, and a "You there?" from ScottB, she began to calm down, and then proceeded to ask:


`SamanthaIAm: It won't affect my normal life will it? I'm not into humiliation`


  That wasn't strictly true, she actually found the idea of being made to humiliate herself quite arousing. It wasn't the humiliation, but that someone has so much control over her that he could make her do something she really didn't want to do. But she wanted that to stay a fantasy, at least for now.


`ScottB: Oh don't worry. It won't go that far.`

`ScottB: Unless you want it to.`


  That made her feel safer, but did nothing to satisfy her curiosity about the triggers. She almost felt like she would beg to know, but another message distracted her.


`ScottB: So, are you alone?`

`SamanthaIAm: yes`

`ScottB: Good. So what should we take off first?`

`ScottB: Your pink tanktop, or your white shorts?`

`SamanthaIAm: I uhh`

`ScottB: I think the tanktop should go first.`


  Before she even finished reading, her hands grabbed onto the bottom of her shirt, and pulled up. Again, she realized what she was doing, but just could not stop it. Her arms continued to rise, and as her top crested her breasts, a wave of arousal and helplessness came over her. She struggled just to think, astonished at what had happened. Her breath quickened yet again, and once her arms stopped moving of their own will, she instinctively covered herself. It took another moment to begin her reply.


`SamanthaIAm: hey! How do you do that? I know you have the brackets thing, but how`

`ScottB: I just asked you :)`

`ScottB: So, how do you like that outfit you have on?`

`SamanthaIAm: It's fine, i guess...`

`ScottB: Do you normally go out in public like that?`

`SamanthaIAm: It's actually just my work out clothes, so not too often.`

`ScottB: I think you should look down.`


  In that moment, she felt a little cold. Samantha looked down and saw that the only thing on her body was her panties. All of her clothes, save for those light pink panties, were strewn around her chair. Her breath caught in her throat, and she felt the most delicious sense of vulnerability. Her hands moved faster than her mind.


`SamanthaIAm: oh my god!`

`SamanthaIAm: when di you`

`ScottB: Just now :)`

`SamanthaIAm: i cant believe it`


  No sooner than she had reached down to grab her shorts had she found that she had already been redressed. She felt a bit confused for a second as to what had just happened, when she realized she felt calm and yet alert, just as before. Samantha took a moment to look about the room, and focused again on the computer screen.


`ScottB: Hey`

`ScottB: How do you feel?`

`SamanthaIAm: good. what just happened?`

`ScottB: I put you back into trance :)`

`ScottB: You were getting pretty excited just now.`

`SamanthaIAm: What did I do?`

`ScottB: Oh not much. Just begged me to do more with you.`

`SamanthaIAm: so what did you do?`

`ScottB: Long story short, I gave you a game to play.`

`ScottB: Throughout tomorrow, you will notice some things here and there,`

`ScottB: that will remind you how good a subject you are,`

`ScottB: and the game will end when you come back here tomorrow night :)`

`SamanthaIAm: really? That sounds like fun!`

`ScottB: Oh, it will be.`

`SamanthaIAm: So what are the rules?`

`ScottB: You don't need to know the rules.`

`ScottB: Your subconscious knows them for you :)`


  Something deep down made Samantha really like this idea. Not just the game, but the fact that she would play it without even knowing what would happen. All she knew about the game is that her mind would play it for her. She didn't even know how, or when, and that made it all the more exciting for her.


`ScottB: I guess that's that, but we can still play a little`

`SamanthaIAm: oh, actually it's getting a little late and I have some errands to run`

`ScottB: Okie-dokie then, see you tomorrow!`

`*[INFO] ScottB has left.*`


  She hopped off her computer, still feeling energetic from the recent hypnosis. *If hypnosis always makes me feel this good, just that will make it worth it*. She put some pizza rolls in the oven, and answered emails while she waited for them to cook. Once they finished, she headed out to the store to buy some cake mix. She was going to her cousin's 18th birthday party the next day, and she wanted to bring bring something fun. When she got home (having bought far more than she meant) she put on some pajamas and went to bed. She fell asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow.
