{"name":"Sleepy-story","tagline":"It's an erotic hypnosis story about a girl named Samantha who finds out about Sleepychat","body":"Primarially written by Scott Butcher (that's me), but I've had a lot of help from verin555 (who wrote the first chapter), ElysianTail (Who wrote Chapter 5), and a *lot* of editing help from Hypnonymoose and Anonymoususer2.\r\n\r\nThis is a story that is hopefully going to be uploaded on [MCStories](http://www.mcstories.com/). \r\nIt is in reality a thinly veiled advertisement for [Sleepychat](http://www.sleepychat.com/), a chatting site for hypnotists and subjects, which needs more love.\r\n\r\nPlot\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe story centers around a girl name Samantha who is frustrated with a hypnosis site (Omegle, but we don't mention it by name), but a friend tells her about Sleepychat and she has all kinds of wacky adventures. She starts out in matchmaking, later does stuff in the public chat, and *maybe* she'll do skype eventually, although she isn't comfortable with that at the begining. Also, there's lots of pop-culture references, and several of the people she meets on sleepychat are regulars in the sleepychat community. The story is going to be mostly within the bounds of reality, although some parts of hynosis are going to be exagerated to make for a better story. We haven't decided on the whole plot yet, but if you have any ideas or some fetish you don't see enough of, let me know at scottcbutcher63@gmail.com!\r\n\r\nAlso, not sure how the others have been picturing her but I (Scott) imagine her kinda like this: \r\n![Samantha is hot](http://i.imgur.com/m41apuO.jpg)\r\n\r\n[Image by Zko](http://hypnohub.net/post/show/12153?pool_id=150)\r\n\r\nNote: The story is currently a work in progress, but you can download the .md (just rename them to .txt) files up at the top. If you see any problems (or have any ideas), send us an email, use github to submit an issue, or fork it if you're feeling adventurous :)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
