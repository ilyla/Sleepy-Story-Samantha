------------

Samantha is a very good maid. Tonight Master is hosting a movie night with his friends, which means her job to make food and serve drinks and sate whatever other needs Master's friends have. How exciting! And they were all here already, sitting on the couch with Master, watching Stir of Echoes, sipping beers, eating snacks. But as she walked back and forth from the kitchen to the living room, refilling drinks, preparing snacks, she could feel them looking less and less at the movie, and more and more at her, half-naked in her French maid outfit, helplessly exposed, stripping her in their minds. God, it was making her horny.

Whenever she served them some drinks, she made sure to lean all the way forward, making her unbelievably deep cleavage spill out of her tiny top. She loved seeing them just looking at her, mesmerized, unable to tear their eyes away. And whenever she walked back to the kitchen to bring some snacks, she was sure to sway her hips back and forth, making her round, bubble butt stick even further out from her tiny skirt, jiggling with every step. Occasionaly she'd even "accidently" drop something and bend all the way down, just to remind them of her completel lack of underwear, to feel their eyes on her glistening snatch, to see the tents in their pants.

It wasn't always like this, was it? She could still remeber something... something before Master, something boring, sad, lonely... But it wasn't important anyway. She smiled happily. Now she has Master, and he takes care of her, and loves her, and owns her. All he wants in return is her neverending servitude. As if she wouldn't have given it to him anyway.

Master snapped his fingers. She knew exactly what this means. Smiling happily -- this was, after all, her purpose -- she stripped naked and stood in front of the couch, his friends, their arousal against hers. She shivered in sheer delight at what's to come. And she felt whole.

Samantha snapped up in her bed, breathing heavily. She looked around her room. Everything was normal. She was normal. And naked. Again. The clothes she went to bed with were folded in a neat pile next to the bed. And there was a sticky mess between her legs. What did she dream about? Something about a party... some friends? She shook her head. It's probably not important anyway.

She got up from bed, stretching, and went into the shower. She turned on the warm water and let it wash over her, waking her body up. She found herself smiling to herself as the hot water poured over her. She was always a morning person. She started soaping herself up, her arms, chest, belly, and down to her va--*pussy*. She blinked in surprise. Where did that word come from? She always uses the word v--*pussy*. Oh, that's right. Her *pussy* (yes, that seems right) was still very sensitive. Was it that dream? She shook her head again, washed the soap away, and toweled herself off. She had the whole day, she wasn't about to waste it idling, thinking about weird (*sexy*) dreams.

She put on some old baggy morning clothes and went downstairs to make scarmbled eggs for breakfast. As she prepared her eggs, she found herself humming some beautiful tune to herself, repeating over and over. She didn't think she'd ever heard that tune before, but it was beautiful, and relaxing, so she sang it some more. It was so easy to just relax into making the eggs, into the tune, maybe she sang some words, hardly even noticing, probably not important. It was a very nice song to sing to herself whenever she was alone. It made her feel good and happy, a bit absentminded, like she didn't have a care in the world. It was very easy to get lost in, just singing it over and over...

A shriek from her phone snapped her out of it, her heart almost leaping out of her chest. After taking a moment to calm herself down again, she checked her phone and found a text message from her cousin Andrew. She sighed. Her song was so nice. Although, she couldn't remember how it went now. Odd. She shrugged and opened the message.

`Andrew: i need to make a website for college applications. do u think u could design one for me?`

Is her one day off really the time to bother her with work stuff? She moved the eggs to a plate, irritated, and toyed with the idea of ignoring him and trying to remember her little song again (*like a good girl*), but ruled against it. He's still family. She took a spoonful of egg and wrote back:

`*Samantha: Good morning to you too. What kinda website? I can do it for free if you just want something simple.*`

`*Andrew: shouldnt be too hard. i just want something that says my name and has a picture of me and some info*`

`*Andrew: apparently it looks good on a college application*`

She took another bite. There's nothing she'd like less right now than to design websites. But she could probably slap something together using some free host in about half an hour. Shouldn't be too hard.

`*Samantha: Maybe, we'd have to talk about it more.*`

`*Andrew: can u come over to my house in about an hour? so can talk then*`

`*Samantha: Fine, see you then.*`

She sighed again. This was going to be a long day, but at least she still had a bit of me-time. She finished her eggs, and popped on her computer. She hastily replied to a few work emails, and went straight to Hypnohub. On it, she flicked through a few really nice YouTube videos (something by a hypnotic ninja? He had a German accent), and just barely resisted the urge to buy a *really hot* fishnet top and a tiny skirt on amazon.

After a few minutes, she remembered that she needed to pick up some groceries, and drove to Walmart. She picked up a bottle of milk, some eggs, and other boring things, and got back in her car.

She put her key into the ignition and turned, and felt a deep wave of pleasure washing over her, making her hot, horny, needy. All of which would've been very disconcerting *and really hot*, if she didn't suddenly wake up, standing in her house, having just come in with her groceries. She paused and looked around. Everything seemed normal. What's going on with her lately?

She paused and tried to remember what happened on the way back, but something told her it's nothing to worry about, so she just stopped and smiled. She put the groceries where groceries go, barely even noticing the few new sex toys she seemingly picked up without noticing. But that's probably nothing to worry about either, so she hid them at the bottom of her night-stand drawer.

She was about to sit down and log onto Sleepychat again *having finished her task like a good girl*, but then she saw the time, and sighed. She has to go do the thing for Andrew now. Might as well get it over with it so she can come back home *and be rewarded for being a good girl*. She took her phone and drove over to Andrew's.

* * * * *

She ringed the doorbell and waited, when she suddenly noticed she forgot to wear a bra. Her big brea-- *tits* were kept from the world by nothing more than her too-small tank top, and that didn't do much to hide her nipples pointing angrily at the door. This isn't something she ever forgot, but apparently she did today. She moved her hand up to correct her shirt to cover as much of her as it could, and accidentally brushed against a nipple.

She gasped. Fuck, did that feel good. Her hand moving almost on its own, she stroked it again. And again. Then pinched it lightly, and whimpered. It didn't normally feel this good, what was going on with--

"Hey, hey, hey," said a voice, and the door opened. Her hands shot to her sides, and she saw Andrew standing at the door, not even bothering to look up from his drawing pad, a pencil in hand. She was sure he didn't see anything, but she shone bright red anyway, her nipples as hard as bullets.

After a few seconds he looked up at her, smiled, and waved her in, saying, "I'm so glad you made it. I've had a few ideas in the meanwhile." She followed him inside, trying as hard as she could to ignore the very distracting sensations from her shirt, rubbing against her over-sensitive nipples with every step. She gratefully accepted a glass of diet coke from Andrew when he offered.

As she drank and cooled down a bit, Andrew began talking again. "So, I was thinking it should have, like, a blue banner at the top with a picture of me, and my name right below it, and then below that it looks like a tan-ish fabric and it has my GPA and--"

"Hold on." What's he even talking about? "First of, a 'hello' would be nice. Secondly, if you want a super fancy website like that... Well, there's more to it than drawing ideas on a piece of paper. You have to actually write the thing. With computer words." He looked unimpressed. "I can set you up with a simple, free host kinda deal, but you're not going to have that much control over it."

Realization dawned on him, and he seemed almost heartbroken at the thought, as if all his dreams were crushed. After a moment of scrambling, he held up a sketch he had drawn of what he wanted his site to look like. "How much of this do you think will be possible?"

"Well, I'm not really sure," she said, "What we should do is look through the themes on Google Sites and you can find one you li--"

"Heyo, whuddup, Sam!" there came a mighty shout from upstairs, making both Samantha and Andrew jump. 16 year old Rebecca zipped down the large staircase along the rail and hugged Samantha, almost dropping her to the ground.

Andrew didn't seem amused. "Go away, Rebecca, we're trying to talk about my website!"

"The same website you wouldn't stop talking about for the past three days?" she stabbed, making a face at Andrew. "Besides, I think I have the right to chat with my cousin when she finally drops by for a visit." Andrew angrily opened his mouth and then closed it, like he wanted to do something but suddenly thought better of it. Rebecca didn't seem to even notice, and jumped up and down, "Remember that math test I had to study for? I got a 100."

Samantha whistled appreciatively. "A 100? how long did you have to study for?" she asked.

"I actually didn't study at all," replied Rebecca, giggling.

Andrew butted in between them, saying, "A 100 is really, really good. But now, Samantha and I really need to get working on this site--"

"I'm not a kid anymore, Andy. Will you just let me chat with Sam for a minute?"

"Okay, fine, Rebecca," he said, but he smiled victoriously, almost evilly. Then he innocently asked, "Has anything else been going on lately?"

Samantha felt a little tingling in her *horny, dampening, aching pussy*. She tried to ignore it, but over the next couple seconds it grew and grew, making her hornier and hornier, and she knew that in a minute or two she was going to rip her clothes off and grope, pinch, rub, anything to get off, even if she had to do it on the floor in front of Andrew. Her left hand already started to move towards her *wet cunt*.

Next to her, Rebecca slurred, "Sorry, I have to go to the bathroom," and ran off. Andrew just nodded and looked back at Samantha, clearly pleased with the result. "So, as I was saying--"

"Hey, actually, I kinda do too," she said, turning away from a disbelieving Andrew and ran to the nearest bathroom.
