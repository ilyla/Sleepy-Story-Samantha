I never go to Tim Hortons, so I apologize if this depiction is not realistic

    Samantha awoke the next day in a jumble of sheets and comforter, two of her three pillows on the floor halfway across the room. At first, she just laid there, eyes closed, letting herself come to. Lifting her arm from where it hang off the bed, she openned her eyes to find her smooth, red hair strewn across her face. Removing the hair, she took a deep breath in, held it, and stretched both her arms, and her legs. Her last pillow fell off the bed. And as she sat up, her eyes still only half open, she realized that she had been sleeping with her feet near her headboard, completely upside own from her normal position. A moment later, an alert rang from her phone. It was her friend. She had to reach to grab her phone from it's charger, and in doing so she realized she was completely nude, with her pagamas and underwear piled up on the floor next to her. *Now how did that happen?* She instincively covered up with the bedsheet, and grabbed her phone from its spot on the floor. 

<6:56 AM>
The_Id_Monster: Hey! So have you gone to sleepychat yet?
Tweety44: I did.
The_Id_Monster: Well, did you enjoy it?
Tweety44: I met this hypnotist in matchmaking, named ScottB.
The_Id_Monster: Oh, him. Yea he's fun!
The_Id_Monster: So what did you do? Did you orgasm? :3

    Samantha was a little surpised by that last message. Her friend had never directly talked about erotic themes like this before. She looked at the message again.

The_Id_Monster: So what did you do? Did you get hypnotized? :3

    She had misread it, but something seemed off... Something had stirred inside of her, and made her feel... aroused? The feeling was extremely faint, so she dismissed it, and returned to the converstion.

Tweety44: I think I was, actually.
The_Id_Monster: That's great! Told you it was better than Zetle!
Tweety44: Yea... hey I'll talk later.
Tweety44: I need to get dressed and go to work
The_Id_Monster: Cya later then!

	She put some clothes on and went off to work. She was earlier than usual, so she decided to get a Bagel BELT and a coffee at Tim Horton's. Drove to the one she always went to, and parked inside the laundromat next door. She had to wait in line for a few minutes, but it wasn't too bad. Eventually she got to the front of the queue so the boy at the register could take her order.

	"Would you like to have sex today?"

	She stumbled backwards, suprised by the cashier just asking her like that. After a moment, she realized that the man actually had said "What would you like to order today." She felt a little tingling of arousal, but it was faint.

	"Uh, just a cappuccino. Oh yeah, and a bagel belt."

	"That'll be $2.29"

	She handed him a $5 bill and took her change. She went to one of the tables to eat her food, and to think. 10 minutes later, having accomplished the former but not made much progress on the latter, she went to work.
